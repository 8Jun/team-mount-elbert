## Objective:
* The objective of this project is to put into action the big data technology (Hadoop, PySpark, AWS, S3) that we have learned about this semester to ingest a large data set, use basic statistics and analysis of the ingested data set, and display (using Jupyter notebook or other type of visualization) the data set. The application should also show horisontal scaling.

## Data Set:
* CBC News Coronavirus/COVID-19 Articles (NLP)

## Overview:

## Languages and Tools used:
* Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn)
* Hadoop
* PySpark
* AWS (EC2)
* Jupyter/ Googlecolab

## Project Goal:
To understand how the main focus of CBC news articles has evolved during this COVID -19 affected time period by doing the following:
  * Analyzing the trend with the word count of the articles.
  * Analyzing the keywords of articles every month using the wordcloud.
  * Building an Abstractive News summarizer with Seq2Seq (Sequence to Sequence Networks) Model (NLP).
