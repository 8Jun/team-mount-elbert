## Big-Data Project: Sentiment Analysis using Pyspark on coronavirus/COVID-19 news

### Executive Summary:
* We are using the Kaggle dataset on CBC News coronavirus/COVID-19 articles. Our analysis will use Spark with Python, AWS Classroom, and Google Collab in order to examine the effects of COVID 19 in the news and how the media has covered this new pandemic.

### Objective:
* The objective of this project is to put into action the big data technology (Hadoop, PySpark, AWS, S3) that we have learned about this semester to ingest a large data set, use basic statistics and analysis of the ingested data set, and display (using Jupyter notebook or other type of visualization) the data set. The application should also show horisontal scaling.

### Data Set:
* https://www.kaggle.com/ryanxjhan/cbc-news-coronavirus-articles-march-26

### Overview:

### Languages and Tools used:
* Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn)
* Hadoop
* PySpark
* AWS (S3, EMR)
* Jupyter/ Googlecolab

### Project Goal:
To understand how the main focus of CBC news articles has evolved during this COVID -19 affected time period by doing the following:
  * Analyzing the trend with the word count of the articles.
  * Analyzing the keywords of articles every month using the wordcloud.
  * Performing Sentiment Analysis on texts by caculating the polarity score (NLP).
