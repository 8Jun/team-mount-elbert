Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:
  To understand how the main focus of CBC news articles has evolved during this COVID -19 affected time period by doing the following:
    * Analyzing the trend with the word count of the articles.
    * Analyzing the keywords of articles every month using the wordcloud.
    * Building an Abstractive News summarizer with Seq2Seq (Sequence to Sequence Networks) Model (NLP).
 
Requirement Phase I:
  *In the first phase, our team has been discussing functional requirements. We will be ingesting the choosen dataset indivually.
  *Each of us will do exploratory analysis on the ingested dataset and come up with different visualizations.
  *Currently we are also discussing on what visualization tools to be used.
