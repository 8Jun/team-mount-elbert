## Data Set: 
* CBC News Coronavirus/COVID-19 Articles (NLP).

## Languages and Tools used: 
* Spark with Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn), Hadoop, PySpark, Jupyter/ Googlecolab.

## Environment: 
* We will be exploring AWS services (EC2).

## Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:
To understand how the main focus of CBC news articles has evolved during this COVID -19 affected time period by doing the following:
* Analyzing the trend with the word count of the articles.
* Analyzing the keywords of articles every month using the wordcloud.
* Building an Abstractive News summarizer with Seq2Seq (Sequence to Sequence Networks) Model (NLP).
 
## Requirement Phase I:
* In the first phase, our team has been discussing functional requirements. We will be ingesting the choosen dataset indivually.
* Each of us will do exploratory analysis on the ingested dataset and come up with different visualizations.
* Currently we are also discussing on what visualization tools to be used.

## PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
Performance Requirements will be set under conditions to detect the words used the most and least in a news article. The Latent Semantic Analysis determines the similarity of meaning of words and set of words to each other. This will help us interpret what the most words and least words mean for the public and their understanding of COVID-19. 

## TIMELINE
   * Design, Development, Test due April 25th.
   * We will meet twice a week for the next two weeks.
   * Deployment is due April 28th.
   * Presentation due April 28th.
